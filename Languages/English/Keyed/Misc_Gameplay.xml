	<VCR.AdvanceArmor>Enable advanced armor behavior</VCR.AdvanceArmor>
	<VCR.AAtooltip>Armor effectiveness is doubled and armor penetration of weapons is quadrupled by default\n\nThis means that 100% armor will block any attacks with no armor penetration, the equivalent of wearing 200% armor protection in vanilla.\nArmor penetration of weapons has been effectively doubled relative to the displayed armor values\n\nExample:\n50% armor penetration bullet against 200% sharp protection armor\nVanilla: armor is reduced to 150%, damage is halved 25% of the time, blocked 75% of the time.\nAdvanced Armor: armor is reduced to 100%, damage is blocked 100% of the time.</VCR.AAtooltip>
	<VCR.ArmorScale>Armor Penetration threshold: {0}</VCR.ArmorScale>
	<VCR.ArmScaleTooltip>Minimum threshold ap before all damage is blocked\n\nThis threshold is based on 200 divided by the value on the slider or textbox.\n\nRecommended : 100% threshold at an entered value of 2</VCR.ArmScaleTooltip>
	<VCR.PenetrationScale>Armor Penetration Bonus Scaling: {0}</VCR.PenetrationScale>
	<VCR.PenScaleTooltip>Multiplier for all penetration values\n\nUse to maintain a competitive weapon environment in conjunction with armor penetration threshold.\n\nRecommended penetration: 2</VCR.PenScaleTooltip>

	<VCR.AdvanceAccuracy>Enable advanced accuracy calculations</VCR.AdvanceAccuracy>
	<VCR.AAcctooltip>Shooter Skill now affects weapon and weather accuracy, a good shooter should be able to overcome any problems with a gun or weather condition. Turret, smoke, and cover accuracy are not affected.</VCR.AAcctooltip>
	<VCR.AccuracyScale>Accuracy Bonus Scaling: {0}</VCR.AccuracyScale>
	<VCR.AccScaleTooltip>Minimum accuracy before advanced accuracy calculations are activated, inversely related to accuracy per point\n\nWith a higher threshold, each point above the threshold has a smaller effect than with a lower threshold\n\nRecommended accuracy: 5</VCR.AccScaleTooltip>

	<VCR.BulletsWorker>Custom Bullet Damage Worker</VCR.BulletsWorker>
	<VCR.BWorkerTooltip>Bullets now have simulated fragmentation, pass through, and mushrooming damage behaviors based on the stopping power of the weapon, multiple projectiles on the same weapon will use the stopping power value of the first projectile.</VCR.BWorkerTooltip>
	<VCR.ArrowsWorker>Custom Arrow Damage Worker</VCR.ArrowsWorker>
	<VCR.AWorkerTooltip>Arrows now are more likely to hit internal body parts or deal extra cuts if an outside body part is hit.</VCR.AWorkerTooltip>

	<VCR.HandFeetPatch>Cover Hands and Feet</VCR.HandFeetPatch>
	<VCR.HandFeetTooltip>Armor and apparel cover the hands and feet of a pawn, gloves or boots are moved to the headgear layer and can be equipped along with normal armor.</VCR.HandFeetTooltip>
	<VCR.GlassesHelmetPatch>Glasses are not Helmets</VCR.GlassesHelmetPatch>
	<VCR.GlassesHelmetTooltip>Changes eye protection to only cover the eyes instead of including the skull or brain.\n\nAllows for wear of a helmet covering the upper head and separate glasses/goggles in the same layer.</VCR.GlassesHelmetTooltip>
